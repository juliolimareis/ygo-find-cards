## Intro

This is a project that uses Vue.js and Tailwind CSS to create a web application that allows you to search and view information about cards from the Yu-Gi-Oh! game. The aim of this project is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface so that users can easily explore and find cards of interest.

## Functionalities

The project has the following main features:

1. Card Search: Users can search for Yu-Gi-Oh! by name, type, attribute, level, attack, defense and more. The search updates in real-time as the user types, providing relevant results instantly.

2. Detail View: By clicking on a card in the results list, users can view the card's full details, including image, description, type, attributes, stats, effects and any other relevant information.

<!-- 3. Sorting and Filtering: Users can sort and filter the search results according to their drugs. This allows for more advanced search customization, making it easier to find specific cards. -->

3. Responsive Design: The design's interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
